![earbuds-color](https://github.com/vasishth17/Chaudhari_Vasishth_Earbuds/assets/121986393/d6fc7254-3b11-4393-a615-63da4b34f68d)


This project offers a seamless 3D model viewing experience integrated with interactive annotations. Users can navigate around a 3D model and engage with clickable hotspots to gain insights into specific model features, accompanied by descriptive texts and images.

## Features
#### 3D Model Viewer: Uses the <model-viewer> component, allowing smooth navigation, zoom, and rotation functionalities.

#### Interactive Hotspots: Defined areas on the 3D model become alive with information when hovered over.

#### Annotation Details: Get comprehensive information about different parts of the model, supported by vivid imagery for clarity.

#### Responsive Design: Crafted for adaptability, the viewer provides an optimized viewing experience across devices, from desktops to mobiles.

## Usage
### Viewing the 3D Model
Rotate: Drag the model left or right.
Zoom: Scroll up or down.
Pan: Click and drag the model in the desired direction.

### Using Annotations
Hover over any highlighted hotspot on the model. A descriptive annotation, including the title, detailed text, and an image, will pop up, offering more information about that specific part of the model.

### Customization
To swap models or add new annotations:

Replace the 3D model source in the <model-viewer> component.
Define new hotspots and provide corresponding annotations in the JavaScript configuration.

### Dependencies
<model-viewer>: A web component used for rendering and interaction with 3D models.
